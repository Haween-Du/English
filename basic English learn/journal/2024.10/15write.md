Recently I've noticed how insane the social media game is nowadays. people are really out here getting millions of likes for taking a mere selfies. So the other day after l spent hours scrolling through Instagram. indulging in the unrealistic modern day beauty standards created by influencers and celebrities. I had an idea.

today maybe id the most miserable day in my entire life, because there is a lot od things I don't finish , but I need finish them before I'm going to go home.
